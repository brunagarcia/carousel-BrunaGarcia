Create a responsive switcher that provides 2 related switchers - one for main images and one for thumbnails. It should include the following:
- responsive;
- touch - the user should be able to drag both carousels back and forward;
- captions - captions should be updated from picture to picture;
- animation - the carousels should animate where applicable;

Please spend about 2 hours putting this together and prioritise features and functionality accordingly. We don't expect this to be complete, but by the time you're done it should at least work in a basic sense. Please use any libraries you want to, but the fewer libraries used (and the fewer complex libraries) the better.
